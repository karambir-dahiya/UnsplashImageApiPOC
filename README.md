# UnsplashImageApiPOC

1. Just clone the Repository and run project directly. It should run without errors.
2. First screen will load all the images fetched from UnSplash API if API provides result as 'success'. In case of failure i have just addedd a pop up to retry the API call.

3. If we fail to load a specific image then we are showin a warning system image.
4. On click of a specific image we are navigating to detail screen where we are showing the full image.
